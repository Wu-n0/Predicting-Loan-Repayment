# Predicting Loan Repayment using LendingClub Data

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a robust predictive model using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club). The dataset contains historical data on loans given out, including information on whether or not the borrowers defaulted. The main objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a borrower will pay back their loan or default.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and is a subset of the LendingClub DataSet. LendingClub is recognized as the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform, based in San Francisco, California. The dataset provides valuable information on loans, including the loan status, which will serve as the label for prediction.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to construct a robust predictive model that can effectively determine whether a borrower is likely to repay their loan or not. By leveraging historical data, we aim to develop a model that can assess the creditworthiness of new potential customers accurately. This will enable us to make informed decisions when approving or rejecting loan applications in the future.
