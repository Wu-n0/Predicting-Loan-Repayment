# Predicting Loan Repayment using LendingClub Data

## Introduction

This project focuses on building a robust predictive model using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club). The dataset contains historical data on loans given out, including information on whether or not the borrowers defaulted. The main objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a borrower will pay back their loan or default.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and is a subset of the LendingClub DataSet. LendingClub is recognized as the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform, based in San Francisco, California. The dataset provides valuable information on loans, including the loan status, which will serve as the label for prediction.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to construct a robust predictive model that can effectively determine whether a borrower is likely to repay their loan or not. By leveraging historical data, we aim to develop a model that can assess the creditworthiness of new potential customers accurately. This will enable us to make informed decisions when approving or rejecting loan applications in the future.

Let's proceed with the implementation of the notebook to explore the dataset, perform data analysis, and build the predictive model.
